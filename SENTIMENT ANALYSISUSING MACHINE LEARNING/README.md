# SENTIMENT ANALYSIS USING MACHINE LEARNING

## ABSTRACT


With the increasing rate at which data is created by internet users on various
platforms, it becomes necessary to analyze and make use of the data by the
Defense and other Government Organizations and know the sentiment of the
people. This shall help the organizations take control of their actions and decide
the steps to be taken shortly. Added to it, when something crucial is happening
in the nation, it is of paramount importance to decide every step without
hurting/violating the sentiments of the people. In the era of Microblogging,
which has become quite a popular tool of communication, millions of users
share their views and opinions on various day-to-day life issues concerning them
directly or indirectly through social media platforms like Twitter, Reddit,
Tumblr, Facebook. Data from these sites can be efficiently used for marketing or
social studies. In this project, we have taken into account various methods to
perform sentiment analysis. Sentiment Analysis has been performed by using
Machine Learning Classifiers. Polarity-based sentiment analysis are used to
classify user's text or given URL of an article having ‘positive’ or ‘negative’
sentiment. These classification models can further be implemented to classify
live tweets on twitter on any topic.
